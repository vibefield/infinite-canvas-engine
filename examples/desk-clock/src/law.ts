// The DESK CLOCK's law — pure: no GPU, no world. A round clock lying face up on the mat: its case (the bezel ring and the

// the clock is set (its style, its rings, its seconds hand, its zone) and the host's wall clock supplies the hour — so two
// desks in a room agree on every prop and each reads its own clock. Every function here is the CPU mirror of clock.wgsl's
// arithmetic or the wake's (local.ts): what is picked is what is drawn, and a desk wakes exactly when a hand must move.

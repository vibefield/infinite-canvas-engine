// The desk clock's LOOK: its dials' colours, per style — the plugin's own palette (a kind in its own package ships its look as the
// reference kinds ship theirs in `deskPalette`), which a host may replace by naming `clocks` in the palette it mounts the desk with
// (`ClockPalette`). The same colours by day and by night: the LIGHT changes (the Moon, the night's chain — the kit's), and the
// graphite dial's lume glows. The shader names no colour; the record carries these.

// The desk clock's state on ONE desk (`ObjectKind.local`) — THE REGISTERED WAKE (design-016 K7a, used as a plugin uses it). The
// hands move on the host's wall clock, never on a poll: each clock the builder records says what it shows (`saw` — its cadence,
// a second or a minute, and its time key); the desk asks `due` after every step and gets the wall clock's next boundary a drawn
// clock needs, on its own frame clock; at that step `tick` finds the key turned and says so — the kind is RESTLESS for one build,
// every drawn clock's record is remade (reading the new time), and the loop sleeps again. A desk at rest with a clock showing
// seconds takes a frame a second, without seconds a frame a minute, and with no clock drawn none at all: a clock culled, gone or
// pinned (a still's time) is not waited on. The builder remakes EVERY drawn clock at a restless build, so the set is rebuilt
// then — a clock that left the screen costs at most the one wake it was already owed.
